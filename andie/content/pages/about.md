Hi, my name is Andie Bradley (they/them). I am a graduate student at Easter Michigan University finishing a MS in Computer Science. Previously I worked at a healthcare IT company called Epic in Madison WI. I currently live in Madison, WI in a housing cooperative with 15 other people and 1 cat.


### Interests ###
My interests include hiking, biking, and backpacking. I am also a private pilot and currently fly a 1968 Piper Cherokee.

### Research ###
My current research deals with neural style transfer and exploring relationships between different pre-trained neural network and the image complexity of generated style transfer images.

### Computer Stuff ###
I've recently gotten into C programming and operating system stuff. I highly recommend you take a look at [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau if you are looking for a free resource start learning. The best way to learn things is to just start doing them. Read some of the chapters and then do the assignments and projects. 

I'm also particularly interested in the BSD family of operating systems. All of them provide clean code you can understand, and solid man pages for the things you don't understand yet. I am also the maintainer for the FreeBSD port of [Halloy](https://halloy.squidowl.org)

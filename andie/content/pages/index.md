## Things Interesting Me Now ##

### Books ###
- [How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakey): George Lakey is a Quaker who was active in the civil rights and LGBT rights movements. This book is an update of an earlier work that reflects his beliefs and decades of experience in nonviolent movements
- [A Short History of Trans Misogyny](https://www.jgillpeterson.com): I highly recommend the works of Jules Gill-Peterson to anyone who has read Julia Serano's Whipping Girl. Jules is an Associate Professor of History at John Hopkins, and her recent work deals with the lives of Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor trans women. 

### Movies ###
- [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(2024_film)): This year's Oscar winner for for best animated feature. It's got a cat protagonist and a lot of heart.
- [Ghostbusters: Afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters:_Afterlife): It's not great cinema, but the nostalgia for millennials of a certain age.

### TV ###
- [The Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pitt): A new medical drama from the creator of ER, this takes me back to the health IT work I did during COVID.
- [Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invincible_(TV_series)): I feel like Invincible is a better interpretation of what things would be like if superheros were real. At least a better interpretation than The Boys.

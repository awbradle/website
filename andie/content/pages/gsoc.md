Availability: I'm able to commit up to 40 hours/week to this project. I am also  wrapping up a graduate research project with my advisor's lab this semester. I am unfunded for the summer with my lab and university, but I will be spending some time finalizing and submitting a paper to a conference with a submission deadline of August 20. The majority of this work will be completed before the start of Community Bonding in May.<br/>

Travel: I am traveling from May 24 until June 1 to visit family in Portland, Oregon (UTC-7). I am available for short meetings and calls at this time if scheduled ahead of time. I can also be reached via email. 

###  Biography ###
Hi, my name is Andie Bradley (they/them). I am a graduate student at Easter Michigan University(EMU) finishing a MS in Computer Science. I am currently working with the Embedded AI Systems Lab at EMU. My current research involves analysis of art created using a technique called neural style transfer, a technique commonly used for styling images like famous artwork using neural networks. Examples can be seen on [my website](http://emunix.emich.edu/~abradl26). 

Previously I worked at a healthcare IT company called Epic in Madison WI, where I worked as a software developer from 2018-2024. This involved mostly working with C# and Javascript/Typescript. I also developed a number of internal tools for customer system configuration analysis using a proprietary database system, and scripting languages such as Perl and Python. I did development from 2018-2022, and later worked as a project manager until 2024.

My experience with FreeBSD started in October 2024, when I installed it on a spare desktop computer because I was looking for an environment to practice C and learn more about operating systems. I have been working through course materials in the [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) book. Since then I have contributed a port of [Halloy](https://halloy.squidowl.org), an IRC client.

##Project Information##

###Project Description###
A few paragraphs describing your project. Direct copies from the ideas page will be rejected - proposals should reveal that you have done some research into the problem and its solutions. Include both what you will be doing and why it is a good thing for The FreeBSD Project.

###Deliverables###
Midterm 

###Test Plan###
Usability testing will be important to a project seeking to make WiFi configuration easier for end users. I hope to solicit feedback from the [Laptop and Desktop Working Group](https://wiki.freebsd.org/LaptopDesktopWorkingGroup). The user stories in the [Laptop Support and Usability project](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop) should also considered, particularly:
- [Automatically connect to known Wi-Fi networks](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/3)
- [Easy connect to WiFi](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/4)

###Project Schedule###
Week 

###Reach Goal###
A potential reach goal involves using code from this project to create a GUI tool to connect to WiFi networks.
